* There are some new [generic top level domains](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_top-level_domain) I had not known about. Most of them seem to be tied to specific policies. E.g. the `.jobs` TLD you can only use to advertise jobs for your own company. Not for other companies, and not for other content. That may explain why the TLD `blow.jobs` is still free.
* Cooperatives operate under the [Rochdale Priciples](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochdale_Principles), named after the town Rochdale where they were first set out in 1844.
* The [International Court of Justice](http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/index.php?lang=en) only handles cases that are brought to it by other states. Despite not having any police force or other power countries go to great length to influence the rulings to their advantage and to honour the outcome. There is an [excellent podcast](http://richmedia.lse.ac.uk/summerSchool/20100729_1730_contemporaryDevelopmentsInInternationalLawAndTheRoleOfTheInternationalCourtOfJustice.mp3) from the LSE on this topic (direct link to mp3).
